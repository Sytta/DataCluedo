# DataCluedo

DataCluedo is an exercise session in preparation for the ADA final exam. We developed it with two goals in mind:
* as a self-assessment tool for students, to they can understand their readiness for the fast-paced data analysis required during the final exam
* as a way for the teaching team to design a better-suited final exam, based on the statistics and performance gathered from DataCluedo

As such, working on DataCluedo is **not mandatory**, but it is nevertheless *strongly recommended* :)
Also, your performance on DataCluedo **will not count towards your final ADA grade**.

## What is DataCluedo?

DataCluedo is a small collection of iPython Notebooks, where the data scientist faces seemingly trivial analysis tasks. Most of the analysis is already included in the notebook, so the main effort goes towards reading carefully the instructions, and writing no more than a handful lines of code per notebook. Each notebook is split in 3 sections:
1. an initial set of pre-filled cells, that the data scientist should evaluate just to load the needed variables and modules in memory
2. a middle section (with at least an empty cell) where the data scientist can perform the initial analysis
3. a closing section, where the data scientist has the opportunity to present a new analysis (if deemed necessary).

In order not to tamper with the results of the analysis, please **follow strictly the order of the cells, without reading in advance the whole notebook**.

## Getting Started
This repository contains eight main branches:
* branch number 1, for students who are assigned to group 1
* branch number 2, for students who are assigned to group 2
* branch number 3, for students who are assigned to group 3
* branch number 4, for students who are assigned to group 4
* branch number 5, for students who are assigned to group 5
* branch number 6, for students who are assigned to group 6
* branch number 7, for students who are assigned to group 7
* branch number 8, for students who are assigned to group 8

plus the master branch which contains this README.md file.

Select one of the eight branches according to your assigned grouping, and begin to solve each notebook following the ordering of the filenames (from 1_attempt1, 1_attempt2 to 2_attempt1, 2_attempt2).
Depending on how you use `git` (i.e., command line, GUI tool, etc.), there are multiple ways to switch branches. As usual, Google is your friend :)

As a last resort, you can clone a specific branch with the following command:
```
git clone <url of repo> -b <branch name to be cloned>
e.g., git clone https://github.com/epfl-ada/DataCluedo.git -b even
```

## Submit your solutions
Once you are done, 

* you can submit your solutions for attempt 1 [using this form](https://goo.gl/forms/vANWUZRVozLlZPnd2)
* you can submit your solutions for attempt 2 [using this form](https://goo.gl/forms/5cnCf4wUkS1sAkYg1)

We recommend you to work on the notebooks in order (i.e., they are numbered from 1 to 2) and submit as many as you can by the end of the lab session. In case you won't be able to complete all of them, please submit regardless. We will keep the form open for an additional day or two, so you can update your submission later on (as the submission form supports updates and edits).
